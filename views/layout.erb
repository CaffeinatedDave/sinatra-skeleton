  # Layout.erb
  #
  # This file is the "wrapper" around which your erb templates are displayed.
  #
  # It should be kept as minimal as possible, loading in any scripts that you
  # need on every page (like bootstrap in this example), and leaving your page
  # scripts to be loaded by individual templates.
  #
  # You can also create extra templates for things like menus, or the footer
  # to keep this file a bit neater
